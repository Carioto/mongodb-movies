## Description

This project makes use of the sample_mflix database from MongoDB.

My MVP is:

1. A search option with any of 3 parameters selected,
2. A random movie from a user defined year, and
3. A feedback page.

## Credits

I (David Carioto) was the only coder for this project, however the following were integral to my success: great use of the online docs, stack overflow (special thanks to [Mike Floyd](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2805154/michel-floyd) for getting me focused in the right area at a key juncture), logo design by [logo.com](logo.com), and some neat button layouts from [Robin Delaporte](https://github.com/robin-dela)

## Tests

The MongoDB Movies database has 21,349 documents in the movies collection.
